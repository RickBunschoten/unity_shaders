# unity_shaders
A unity project which will consist of a collection of my self-written, but sometimes inspired shaders.  

Inspiration will mostly come from shadertoy and where applicable i'll add reference
The shaders can be found as sub folders in the unity project.
In addition to the shaders there is also a small utility script for post-processing which layers all applied effects in order.
This generally was made more for testing purposes then actual usability.
